# TechCrunch-Verification-Codes
I have written a unit test for the main page and one of the news page in https://techcrunch.com. This code does the following: 

For the “The Latest News” list in the mainpage, it verifies;

a. if each news has an author

b. if each news has an image

Then it clicks one of the news from “The Latest News” list to reach the full content and then it verifies;
a. if the browser title is the same with the news title
b. if there are links within the news content
